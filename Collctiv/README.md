#### Project Description
Collctiv is a decentralized polling, Q&A and voting platform that allows users to create polls, ask survey questions, vote on polls and questions and even reward contributors with cUSD. 
It is built on the Celo blockchain protocol and will use the IPFS protocol to store data. The hope is to be a decentralized alternative to platforms like Google Forms, Typeform, Survey Monkey, and Vevox.


#### Summary
Collctiv will be a web application that will be accessible via any device with a web browser. It will include two main parts: a view(s) to create the polls, survey or Q&As, and another view where users can anonymously vote on polls, answer survey questions and and ask questions. For Paid surveys, creators will be able to send cUSD and users will be able to connect and withdraw funds to their celo wallet.
